Badgerchat was a web application that was made using React for the UI and Postman for the API. It was written in JavaScript, HTML, and C. It was meant to be a forum board for students of UW Madison to talk and plan meet-ups. I received a 4/4 on it. Unfortunately the data used is in accessible to anyone outside of the UW Madison system as it does contain some personal information of the students who used it. A video demo of the mobile version, which was a later project, is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDfRx0j30Go. I was provided some starter code but the majority of the functionality was written by me.
