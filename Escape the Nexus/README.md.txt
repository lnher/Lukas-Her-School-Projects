Escape the Nexus is a game I made in Unity for a final project. All code was written in C# and most assets used were made by me. I received 64/64 on it. The sprites, shaders, and game objects were all made by me and the only things I did not create were the skybox and music. The game can also be played in browser at https://play.unity.com/en/games/24073e45-e63f-4bef-91b9-b3634d9a2d65/escape-the-nexus-demo.

I will also include another game I made for a 2 day game jam called Balloon Bonanza. I created the sprites and animations but all coding for that project was done by my colleague. It can be found at https://pyrousha.itch.io/virusballoongame. 

Lastly have also included some songs that I composed for a scrapped game as MP3's.
