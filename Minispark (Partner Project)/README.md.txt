Minispark was a primitive recreation of the Apache Spark framework using C. It was multithreaded to speed up data tree traversal and transformations and to handle nested commands. I received a 38/40 on it passing all tests but was docked the 2 points due to a memory leak that I was unable to fix within the time constraints. I worked with a partner on this project using pair programming. I was usually the one coding and they would help guide and review the code I wrote.
