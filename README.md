# Lukas-Her-School-Projects
A collection of projects completed in my college career as well as some personal projects. Some projects may not be fully functional as they use data sets owned by UW Madison or contain some sensitive personal information of the students in the class. 
Additionally some projects contain starter code that was not written by me and was provided by the instructors but I wrote the majority of the code in these projects. The projects that were not done solo will be labeled.
